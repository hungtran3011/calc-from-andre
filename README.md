# calc-from-andre
A (simple) customizable calculator

## What I have done:
- Simple math operations (+, -, *(times), /(divide)
- Use an ANS variable to store the results of calculations
- Use several other variables for more complex calculations

## What I need to complete
- Add 'Settings' and 'Mode' dialog
- Re-implement the algorithm used for calculations
- Symbols: use Ã· instead of / for division, Ã— instead of * for times
- Add square roots and n-roots of numbers
- Add percentage calculation

## Optional features to add:
- Scientific mode:
  - Trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, with degrees and radians are supported, and re
  - Powers and logarithms, with e constant supported
  - Factorials, combinations and permutations calculator
  - Greatest common factors (GCF/GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and more positive integers
- Conversion mode: the conversion between the units of distance, mass or volume, etc.
And more features if I have free time to add ðŸ˜Š
