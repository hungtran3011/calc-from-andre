## About this project

This project is/was created at the end of my summer vacation, before my first year at uni üòÅ.

Having learnt Python for a year, I decided to create a decent project so that I could practice what I had learnt and share my work to the community
 
 
**Language and framework specs:**
- <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python 3.10 </a>
- <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/"> PySide6 - Official Qt6 bindings for Python from the Qt for Python project </a>

**System requirements**

According to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/supported-platforms.html">Qt6 system requirements</a> :

- Windows (64 bit): Windows 10 or higher
- GNU/Linux (X11) (64 bit): Ubuntu 20.04 or higher, CentOS 8.4 or higher, etc.
- MacOS (64 bit): MacOS 10.14 (Mojave) or higher

This software is NOT tested on ARM chips yet so please help me optimize the software to these chipsets.

## What I have done:

- Simple math operations (+, -, * (times), / (divide))
- Use an ```ANS``` variable to store the results of calculations
- Use several other variables for more complex calculations
- **UPDATE 25/09/2022**: Complete the UI part for ```scientific``` mode
- **UPDATE 09/10/2022**: '''Measurement''' converter is ready for testing!!!

## What I need to complete

- Add ```Settings``` and ```Mode``` dialog
- Re-implement the algorithm used for calculations
- Symbols: use ```√∑``` instead of ```/``` for division, ```√ó``` instead of ```*``` for times
- Add square roots and n-roots of numbers
- Add percentage calculation
- **UPDATE 25/09/2022**: Complete ```scientific``` mode, complete the UI for the ```unit of measurement converter``` and ```currency converter``` mode

Details can be seen at ```changelog.md```

## What I want to add to the calculator
- Polynomial and Simultaneous Equations calculator
- Ratio calculator
- Complex calculator

And more features and updates if I have free time to add üòä
